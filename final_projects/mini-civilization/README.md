# MINI-CIVILIZATION

This projects aims to reproduce basic mechanisms of the Civilization game.

Some basic description:
* you start with 1 character and 50 golds
* the game will be played turn by turn (every command will
  immediately be applied, consuming 1 or more turns).
* the character can build two kinds of buildings:
  - a gold mine which costs 30 golds and generates 10 golds by turn.
  - a house which costs 30 golds and can produce a character by turn for 15 golds.
* all the game will run on an map with cells on integer coordinates. Two building 
  cannot share the same cell. The characters can share a same cell.
* the goal is to reach the highest gold level in 100 turns.
