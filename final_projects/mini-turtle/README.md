# MINI-TURTLE

This projects aims to reproduce basic features of the Logo programming
langage: the user enters a list of commands that make a turtle moving on
the screen. The turtle has a pen on its tail, so we can draw with it!

**SIMPLIFCATIONS:** we wont try making the turtle smoothly move. When the user
enters the command, the turtle immediatly move to its next position and the line
is directly drawn.

## Minimal set of features
* support the `forward 10` command which makes the turtle advance by 10 units (up to you to define 
  what a handy "unit" would be: px? 100px?). *Note: of course, the `10` can vary, the user may enter any integer.*
* support the `pen_up` and `pen_down` instructions. When the pen is "up", the turtle moves without
  drawing anything behind it.
* support `turn_left 20` and `turn_right 20` which makes the turtle turn on it self by `20` degrees (once again, this
  `20` may actually be any integer).
* change the color: `color red` (you can define the set of color you like).
* clean the screen without changing turtle position: `clean`.





## Optional features
* repeat commands multiple times: `repeat 4 [ forward 10, turn_left 90 ]`
  (this draws a square!).
* make it possible to define some numeric variables:
 `var x = 8`. With, we can easily define polygons: 
 ```var x = 10 repeat x [ forward 10, turn_left 360 / x]```
* make it possible to define some procedures:
  ```proc square = repeat 4 [ forward 10, turn_left 90 ] end``` Then we can invoke this procedure by just writing `square`.
* add some parameters to the procedures:
  ```proc square length = repeat 4 [ forward length, turn_left 90 ]```
* make it possible for the user to save the current session as a file and to restore the session by loading the file.
  *Hint: the whole state of the session only depends on the user commands.*
