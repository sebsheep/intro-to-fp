# FINAL PROJECTS

You have to chose on project among the following:
* mini-bash
* mini-mapple
* mini-turtle
* mini-geogebra
* mini-...?


## Common instructions for all projects


Almost all interactions with the software will use an emulated command line in the browser
(the bootstrap project will provide a skeleton for this).

The evaluation will mainly focus on code quality and features.
Efforts on UI will NOT be taken into account, so don't spend too much time on it.
(That said, in "real" projects, UI/UX really is important and you have to polish it
as much as possible).

You'll have to provide a "gitified" project. I ask you to issue a commit
at least every 4 hours of work (it would even be better for you to commit
more regularly :) ).


If you have other ideas than what I'm proposing in the project description,
feel free to reach me out to speak about it.
